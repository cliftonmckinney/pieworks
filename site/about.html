				<h3>About us</h3>			
				<h4>Pieworks is brought to you by the team who built Work for Pie. We're changing the way software developers find work.</h4>				
				<p>Back in 2011 we noticed that most good recruiting happens via word of mouth. We also noticed that most online alternatives were terrible substitutes.
				We created <a class="simple_link" target="_blank" href="https://workforpie.com/">Work for Pie</a> with the real world experience in mind. It's a place where software developers 
				can showcase their best work, connect with each other, and learn about amazing companies.</br></br>
				Work for Pie is a great recruiting tool, but it shouldn't be the only tool. 
				Pieworks came about because we realized that many of our clients didn't have the time or expertise to do recruiting really well, and they didn't know where to start. 
				They were taking shots in the dark with job boards or similar, or were paying tens of thousands of dollars per placement to headhunters that cared little about their company or their culture.
				We knew we could help them do it better.
