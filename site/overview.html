				<h3>About Pieworks</h3>			
				<h4>Pieworks is recruiting done well. We work with companies to build a comprehensive, repeatable, proactive recruiting strategy. </h4>				
				<p>Benjamin Franklin said that "an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure." At its core, that's what Pieworks is all about. 
				We help companies build a proactive recruiting process from the ground up so that they save time and money and, most importantly,
				so that they can find the very best candidates for their team. We look at three key areas: </p></br>
					<li>1. Perception (Do the right people know you exist?)</li></br>
					<p>Sometimes the best candidates are right around the corner, and sometimes they're a world away. Our perception analysis 
					helps you determine exactly what the ideal candidate looks like, and then helps you determine 
					if the current channels you use to recruit that candidate are effective.</p></br>
					<li>2. Interest (Do the people who know you like you?)</li></br>
					<p>Exposure is only the first step in effective proactive recruiting. Once they're aware of you, our Interest analysis will 
					make sure the best candidates actually like you. We'll look at your copy, your competition, your job profiles and more to 
					make sure you're putting your best foot forward.</p></br>
					<li>3. Engagement (Are you developing relationships with these potential candidates?)</li></br>
					<p>The best candidate is always out there, but sometimes the timing is off. Communication is the key to reducing the effects 
					of bad timing. Unless they apply to your open position, odds are you don't communicate with interested candidates. We'll
					help you change that.</p></br></br>
				<p>Pieworks happens in two phases. The first (analysis and re-construction) takes approximately four weeks. The purpose of phase
				one is to successfully transition a company from reactive recruiter to proactive recruiter. Phase two (management) is ongoing. Once you've
				successfully transitioned, we can manage some or all aspects of your recruiting going forward. <a class="simple_link" href="/contact.html">Contact us</a> to learn more.</p>
